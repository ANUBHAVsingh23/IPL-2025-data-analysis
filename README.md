# IPL Deliveries Data Analysis (2022-2025)
This project analyzes IPL deliveries data from the 2022 to 2025 seasons to understand key aspects of the game, including runs scored, wickets taken, and dismissal types.

Data
The analysis uses the following datasets:

ipl_2022_deliveries.csv
ipl_2023_deliveries.csv
ipl_2024_deliveries.csv
ipl_2025_deliveries.csv
These files contain detailed information about each ball bowled in the respective seasons.

Analysis
The analysis performed includes:

Loading and combining the data from the four seasons.
Handling missing values and ensuring correct data types.
Calculating total runs scored per match.
Calculating total wickets taken per match.
Analyzing the distribution of different wicket types.
Visualizations
The following visualizations were generated:

Histogram of total runs scored per match.
Histogram of total wickets taken per match.
Bar plot of the distribution of wicket types.
Key Findings
The distribution of total runs scored per match across the 2022-2025 IPL seasons is visualized in a histogram, showing the frequency of different run totals.
The distribution of total wickets taken per match across the 2022-2025 IPL seasons is shown in a histogram, indicating the frequency of different wicket counts.
A bar plot illustrates the distribution of wicket types, revealing that "caught" is the most frequent type of dismissal, followed by "bowled" and "lbw".
Next Steps
Possible future analysis could include:

Exploring trends in runs scored and wickets taken over the years to see if there are significant year-on-year variations.
Investigating the distribution of wicket types by bowling style (pace vs. spin) to understand their impact on dismissals.
